Final project for graduate course in Artificial Intelligence on the use of AI in mental healthcare
- This project contains multiple jupyter notebooks in python, a workflow in knime, and some csv files containing the data used in the project
- The goal of this project was to examine how AI is being used in mental healthcare, and to provide some example code files demonstrating some applications
- The main application studied was using Machine Learning for classification using Logisitc Regression, with the dataset being a survey of tech workers on their mental health
- Some work was also done using fuzzy logic but is not as developed, as there was a lack of data
- The paper attached describes all the work done in detail, and includes all references and sources
